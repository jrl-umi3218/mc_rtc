# Directory where mc_rtc dependencies will be cloned
# Defaults to the parent directory of the mc_rtc repository folder
# export SOURCE_DIR=`cd $(dirname $0)/../; pwd`

# Directory where build is done
# Defaults to build
# If the path is absolute (e.g. $HOME/build) then sub-folders are created for each project
# Otherwise the $BUILD_SUBDIR folder is created inside each source folder and automatically excluded from git
# export BUILD_SUBDIR=build

# Path in which mc_rtc and its dependencies will be installed
# Note if different from /usr/local, make sure to appropriately set the paths variables
# The script will automatically inform you of the required paths after successful installation.
# export INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr/local"

##
# Build type.
# - For performance on the robots use "Release"
# - For normal development, "RelWithDebInfo" should be fast enough on most machines
##

##
# Whether to build with ROS support
# On Ubuntu, ROS will be installed if you enable ROS support and ROS_FROM_APT and if it was not already installed. Otherwise, you are required to install ROS by yourself before attempting to install mc_rtc with ROS support;

# Interfaces -- allows communication with the choreonoid simulator, and with the HRP robots.
# Both mc_udp and mc_openrtm require hrpsys-base and its dependencies to be installed. The script does not
# automatically install these dependencies, please install them manually before running the script.
# In case choreonoid was installed in a different path than $INSTALL_PREFIX, set
# MC_UDP_INSTALL_PREFIX and MC_OPENRTM_INSTALL_PREFIX to choreonoid's base installation path
