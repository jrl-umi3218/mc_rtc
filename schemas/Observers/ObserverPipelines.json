  "description": "Configures a sequence of state observation piplines (mc_observers::ObserverPipeline) that will be run sequentially. This may be used to estimate the state of one or multiple robots using a suitable sequence of observers. Observer pipelines may be defined in your mc_rtc.conf, controller-specific configuration, or FSM configuration (each configuration superseeds the previous one). If only one observer pipline is present, the array may be ommitted.",
