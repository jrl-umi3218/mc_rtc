# In this demo, the state of the real robot is not used.

# For the sake of demonstration, this shows how to set up a virtual state observation pipeline
# that simply copies the state of the control robot.
# You may refer to the LIPMStabilizer and AdmittanceSample controllers for more meaningful uses of this feature.
