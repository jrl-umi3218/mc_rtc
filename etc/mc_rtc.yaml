# Default configuration of mc_rtc #
###################################
# This file contains the default configuration of mc_rtc
#
# You may overwrite any of these settings in
# - Linux/MacOS: $HOME/.config/mc_rtc/mc_rtc.yaml
# - Windows:     %APPDATA%/mc_rtc/mc_rtc.conf
#
# For further details, refer to https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/mc_rtc/tutorials/introduction/configuration.html

# What robot is being controlled
MainRobot: JVRC1
# Enabled controllers
Enabled: [CoM]
# Controller timestep
Timestep: 0.005
# Always include the half-sitting controller
# IncludeHalfSitController: true

#####################################
# Initialize floating base attitude #
#####################################
# - When true, initialize attitude from the bodysensor specified by InitAttitudeSensor
# - Otherwise use the robot module halfsitting stance
InitAttitudeFromSensor: false
# BodySensor to initialize from (default = first body sensor)
# - Empty string: use the default body sensor
# - Otherwise use the provided sensor name
# Note that the robot model and encoder values are used to transform the sensor measurements to the floating base frame
InitAttitudeSensor: ""

# State observation pipeline #
##############################
# For details, please refer to:
# - The tutorial: https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/mc_rtc/tutorials/recipes/observers.html for details
# - The JSON Schemas: https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/mc_rtc/json.html#Observers/ObserverPipelines
#
# Loads and run state observers organized in one or multiple pipelines. Observers within each pipeline are run sequentially
# and each estimate some properties of the robots, and optionally update the real robots instance from it.
#
# Available estimators in mc_rtc are:
# - Encoder: Estimate encoder position from sensor and velocity by finite differences
# - BodySensor: Uses a BodySensor to compute the state of the floating base. This estimator will
# typically be used to obtained groundtruth information (e.g the FloatingBase body sensor contains the groundtruth floating base state when running in choreonoid)
# - KinematicInertial: Estimates the position and orientation of the floating base from the IMU orientation and assumed contacts. Note that this estimator requires to provide a kinematic anchor point through the datastore.
#
# To run the observers, please add an "ObserverPipelines" configuration section in your controller-specific configuration file or in you FSM configuration.
#
# Example:
# ObserverPipelines:
# - name: "MainPipeline"
#   observers:
#     - type: Encoder
#       update: true
#       log: true
#       config:
#         position: encoderValues
#         velocity: encoderFiniteDifferences
#     - type: KinematicInertial
#       update: true
#       gui: true
#       config:
#         anchorFrameFunction: "Observer::anchorFrame"

###########
# Logging #
###########
# Set to true or false to enable/disable respectively
Log: true

# LogPolicy dictates whether logging-related disk operations happen in a
# separate thread ("threaded") or in the same thread as the run() loop
# ("non-threaded"). This defaults to the non-threaded policy. On real-time
# systems, the threaded policy is advised
# LogPolicy: threaded

# LogDirectory dictates where the log files will be stored, defaults to
# system temp directory
# LogDirectory: /tmp

# The log file will have the name [LogTemplate]-[ControllerName]-[date].log
LogTemplate: mc-control

#######
# GUI #
#######
# GUIServer section
GUIServer:
  # If true, enable the GUI server, otherwise or if absent, disable this
  # feature
  Enable: true
  # Publication timestep, actual rate is rounded up depending on the controller
  # timestep, a value of 0 indicates that the GUI timestep should be equal to
  # the controller timestep
  Timestep: 0.05
  # IPC (inter-process communication) section, if the section is absent
  # this disables the protocol, if the section is empty it is configured
  # to its default settings.
  IPC: {}
    # If the GUI server IPC protocol is enabled, this is used as a base
    # to create the sockets, the actual sockets name will be formed by
    # adding _sub.ipc and _rep.ipc to the provided path. The file will
    # be created if required. This defaults to $SYSTEM_TMP/mc_rtc
    # Socket: /tmp/mc_rtc
  # TCP section, the same remarks apply as IPC
  TCP:
    # Binding host, * binds to all interfaces
    Host: "*"
    # Binding ports, the first is used for PUB socket and the second for
    # the PULL socket
    Ports: [4242, 4343]
  # # WS (websocket) section, the same remarks apply as IPC
  # WS:
  #   # Binding host, * binds to all interfaces
  #   Host: "*"
  #   # Binding ports, the first is used for PUB socket and the second for
  #   # the PULL socket
  #   Ports: [8080, 8081]

############################
# Loader paths and options #
############################
# Many components of the framework are loaded from libraries (Controllers, Plugins, Observers, etc)
# The default configuration for this section is suitable for loading the components provided and installed along with
# the framework. You may use the following options to load custom modules specified elsewhere.

# The following option change the verbosity of the controller and robot loader
VerboseLoader: false

# The following option is used to disable controller/robot creation sandboxing
# This option only affects Linux
# UseSandbox: true

# The following options are used to control the location of the
# controllers', robots' and observers' modules (libraries)
# The paths added by this option are added to the default path
# ControllerModulePaths: [/one/path/to/controller/, /another/path/]
# RobotModulePaths: [/one/path/to/robot/, /another/path/]
# ObserverModulePaths: [/one/path/to/observer/, /another/path/]
# GlobalPluginPaths: [/one/path/to/global/plugin, /another/path/]

# The following options are used to clear the default loading path
# for controllers, robots and observers respectively
# This is only useful to run test on a machine where mc_rtc has
# already been installed
# ClearControllerModulePath: false
# ClearRobotModulePath: false
# ClearObserverModulePath: false
# ClearGlobalPluginPath: false
