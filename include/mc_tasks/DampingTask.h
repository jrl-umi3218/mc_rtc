/*! \brief Hybrid position-force control on a contacting end-effector.
 *
 * The DampingTask is by default a SurfaceTransformTask, i.e. pure position
 * control of a surface frame. Admittance coefficients that map force errors to
 * displacements (see [1] and [2]) are initially set to zero.
 *
 * When the admittance along one axis (Fx, Fy, Fz, Tx, Ty or Tz) is set to a
 * non-zero positive value, this axis switches from position to force control.
 * The goal is then to realize the prescribed target wrench at the surface
 * frame (bis repetita placent: wrenches are expressed in the surface frame of
 * the task, not in the sensor frame of the corresponding body). The force
 * control law applied is damping control [3].
 *
 * See the discussion in [4] for a comparison with the ComplianceTask.
