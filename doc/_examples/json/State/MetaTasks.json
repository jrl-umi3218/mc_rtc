// In addition, the outputCriteriaTasks array asks the state to generate
// its output string based on the completion criterias of tasks "t1" and "t2".
// The completion output will look like one of the following
// - t1=eval, t2=eval
// - t1=timeout AND speed, t2=eval
// It may be used to trigger branch choices in the FSM
// You may also use the DEFAULT output in your transition maps that will be used in case no other pattern matches
