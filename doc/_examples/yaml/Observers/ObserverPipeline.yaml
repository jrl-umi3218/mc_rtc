# This sample provides a reasonable default pipeline for observing the state (position and velocity) of a floating-base robot.
# This pipeline does the following:
# Encoder:
#   - Joint position is obtained from encoder sensors, joint velocity is estimated by finite differences of position.
#   - Forward kinematics and velocity is computed (required by the BodySensor and KinematicInertial observers to 
#     obtain the transformation from sensor to the floating base)
# BodySensor:
#   - Only logs the values provided by the \"FloatingBase\" body sensor.
#     This assumes that the interface supports such ground truth measurement (e.g simulation, MOCAP)
# KinematicInertial:
#   - Estimates the floating base position using the orientation of an IMU sensor (rigidly connected to the floating base)
#     and a kinematic anchor frame provided by the controller through a datastore function. This frame should represent
#     the same point on both the control robot and real robot, and is used as the reference to compute the floating base
#     position. In the case of a humanoid robot walking, this would be a frame moving continously between the robot feet
#     For example
#
#     datastore().make_call("KinematicAnchorFrame::" + robot().name(), [this](const mc_rbdyn::Robot & robot) {
#       // leftFootRatio is a value between 0 and 1 that continuously moves between each feet as the robot is walking
#       return sva::interpolate(robot.surfacePose("LeftFoot"), robot.surfacePose("RightFoot"), this->leftFootRatio);
#     });
