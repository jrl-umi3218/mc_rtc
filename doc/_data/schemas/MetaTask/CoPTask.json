  "description": "This task control the center of pressure (CoP) of a robot surface attached to a force sensor.<br/>- Force measurements are used in an admittance control law to compute the velocity of the surface motion to bring the measured CoP to its desired target position.<br/>- Only axes where the admittance gains are non null will be affected by force control. Along all other axes, the reference position and velocity will be tracked.<br/>- High stiffness/Low damping will favor position control (targetPose/targetSurface)<br/>- Low stiffness/High damping will favour velocity control.<br />- Use [low-stiffness/high-damping/non-zero admittance gains] to achieve force control along one of the controlled surface axis.",
