[33mCMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

[33mCMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl" with any of the following names:

    mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdlConfig.cmake
    mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "mc_rtc_3rd_party_ltdl" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

[31mCMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
